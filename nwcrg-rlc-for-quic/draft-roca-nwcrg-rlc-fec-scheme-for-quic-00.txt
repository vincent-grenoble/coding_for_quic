1.  Introduction

   QUIC [QUIC-transport] is a new transport that aims at improving
   network performance by enabling out of order delivery, partial
   reliability, and methods of recovery besides retransmission, while
   also improving security.  This document specifies FEC schemes for
   Sliding Window Random Linear Code (RLC) [RLC] to recover from lost
   packets within a single QUIC stream or across several QUIC streams,
   compliant with the FEC coding framework for QUIC [Coding4QUIC].

   The ability to add FEC coding in QUIC may be beneficial in several
   situations:

   o  for a robust transmission of latency sensitive traffic, for
      instance real-time flows, since it enables to recover packet
      losses independently of the round trip time;

Internet-Draft                RLC for QUIC                     June 2018


   o  for the transmission of contents to a large set of QUIC reception
      endpoints, since the same repair frame may help recovering several
      different packet losses at different receivers;

   o  for multipath communications, since repair traffic adds diversity.

2.  Definitions and Abbreviations

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Terms and definitions that apply to coding are available in
   [nc-taxonomy].  More specifically, this document uses the following
   definitions:

   Packet versus Symbol:  a Packet is the unit of data that is exchanged
      over the network while a Symbol is the unit of data that is
      manipulated during the encoding and decoding operations

   Source Symbol:  a unit of data originating from the source that is
      used as input to encoding operations

   Repair Symbol:  a unit of data that is the result of a coding
      operation

   This document uses the following abbreviations:

   E: size of an encoding symbol (i.e., source or repair symbol),
      assumed fixed (in bytes)

3.  Procedures

   This section introduces the procedures that are used by these FEC
   Schemes.

4.  Sliding Window RLC FEC Scheme over GF(2^^8) when Protecting a Single
    QUIC Stream

   This fully-specified FEC Scheme defines the Sliding Window Random
   Linear Codes (RLC) over GF(2^^8).

4.1.  Formats and Codes

4.1.1.  FEC Framework Configuration Information

4.1.1.1.  FEC Encoding ID

4.1.1.2.  FEC Scheme-Specific Information

4.1.2.  REPAIR frame format and Repair FEC Payload ID

   The RLC FEC Scheme does not require any explicit Source FEC Payload
   ID, meaning that QUIC STREAM frames containing source data are not
   modified, whether or not RLC FEC protection is used or not.  On the
   opposite, the RLC FEC Scheme requires QUIC REPAIR frames to convey
   enough information as part of the REPAIR FEC Payload ID, or said
   differently according to QUIC terminology, REPAIR frame format.
