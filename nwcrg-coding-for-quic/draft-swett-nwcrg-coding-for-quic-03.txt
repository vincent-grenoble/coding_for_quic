Abstract

   This document focuses on the integration of FEC coding in the QUIC
   transport protocol, in order to recover from packet losses.  This
   document does not specify any FEC code but defines mechanisms to
   negotiate and integrate FEC Schemes in QUIC.  By using proactive loss
   recovery, it is expected to improve QUIC performance in sessions
   impacted by packet losses.  More precisely it is expected to improve
   QUIC performance with real-time sessions (since FEC coding makes
   packet loss recovery insensitive to the round trip time), with
   multicast sessions (since the same repair packet can recover several
   different losses at several receivers), and with multipath sessions
   (since repair packets add diversity).

1.  Introduction

   QUIC is a new transport that aims at improving network performance by
   enabling out of order delivery, partial reliability, and methods of
   recovery besides retransmission, while also improving security.  This
   document specifies a framework to enable FEC codes to be used to
   recover from lost packets within a single QUIC stream or across
   several QUIC streams.

   The ability to add FEC coding in QUIC may be beneficial in several
   situations:

   o  for a robust transmission of latency sensitive traffic, for
      instance real-time flows, since it enables to recover packet
      losses independently of the round trip time;

   o  for the transmission of contents to a large set of QUIC reception
      endpoints, since the same repair frame may help recovering several
      different packet losses at different receivers;

   o  for multipath communications, since repair traffic adds diversity.

   This framework does not mandate the use of any specific FEC code
   (i.e., how to encode and decode) nor FEC Scheme (i.e., that specifies
   both a FEC code and how to use it, in particular in terms of
   signaling).  Instead it allows to negotiate the FEC Scheme to use at
   session startup, assuming that more than one solution could
   potentially be offered concurrently.  Without loss of generality, we
   assume that the encoding operations compute a linear combination of
   QUIC packets, regardless of whether these codes are of block type (as
   with Reed-Solomon codes [RFC5510]) or sliding window type (as with
   RLC codes [RLC]).

   Packet versus Symbol:  a Packet is the unit of data that is exchanged
      over the network while a Symbol is the unit of data that is
      manipulated during the encoding and decoding operations

   Source Symbol:  a unit of data originating from the source that is
      used as input to encoding operations

   Repair Symbol:  a unit of data that is the result of a coding
      operation

   This document uses the following abbreviations:

   E: size of an encoding symbol (i.e., source or repair symbol),
      assumed fixed (in bytes)

3.  General Design Considerations

   This section lists a few general considerations that govern the
   framework for FEC coding support in QUIC.

3.1.  FEC Code versus FEC Scheme, Block Codes versus Sliding Window
      Codes

   A FEC code specifies the details of encoding and decoding operations.
   In addition to that, a FEC Scheme defines the additional protocol
   aspects required to use a particular FEC code [nc-taxonomy].  In
   particular the FEC Scheme defines signaling (e.g., information
   contained in Source and Repair Packet header or trailers) needed to
   synchronize encoders and decoders.

   Block coding (e.g., Reed-Solomon [RFC5510]) and sliding window coding
   (e.g., RLC [RLC]) are two broad classes of FEC codes [nc-taxonomy].
   In the first case, the input flow must be first segmented into a
   sequence of blocks, FEC encoding and decoding being performed
   independently on a per-block basis.  In the second case rely, a
   sliding encoding window continuously slides over the input flow.  It
   is envisioned that the two classes of codes could be used to bring
   FEC protection to QUIC, usually with an advantage for sliding window
   codes when it comes to low latency communications.

3.2.  FEC Scheme Negotiation

   There are multiple FEC Scheme candidates.  Therefore a negotiation
   step is needed to select one or more codes to be used over a QUIC
   session.  This will be implemented using the one step negotiation of
   the new QUIC negotiation mechanism [QUIC-transport], during the QUIC
   handshake.

   Editor's notes:

       *  It is likely that FEC Scheme negotiation requires the use of a
          new dedicated Extension Frame Type.  To Be Clarified and text
          updated.

       *  It is not clear whether negotiation is meant to select a
          **single** FEC Scheme or **multiple** FEC Schemes.  In the
          second case (multiple FEC) it is required to have a
          complementary mechanism to indicate which FEC Scheme is used
          in a given REPAIR frame (which could be done through as many
          REPAIR frame type values as potential FEC Scheme negotiated).
          Is it what we want to achieve?  Not sure.

       *  It is not clear whether negotiation is carried out at QUIC
          level (and therefore for multiple streams) or at a stream
          level (and therefore multiple streams may use multiple FEC
          Schemes).  The terminology used above should be updated to
          reflect the choice.

3.3.  FEC Protection Within an Encrypted Channel

   FEC encoding is applied before any QUIC encryption and authentication
   processing.  Source symbols, that constitute the data units used by
   the FEC codec, contain cleartext application data.

3.4.  About Middleboxes

   The coding approach described in this document does not allow on path
   elements (middleboxes) to take part in FEC protection.  The traffic
   being encrypted end-to-end, the middleboxes are not in position to
   perform FEC decoding, nor to add any redundant traffic.

3.5.  Source symbol definition

   Although application data are originally intended to be transmitted
   through the QUIC stream abstraction, the design of QUIC aims at easy
   extensibility and other means of application data transmission could
   be added as QUIC extensions.  This is already the case for the
   recently proposed DATAGRAM extension of the protocol.  Moreover, QUIC
   transfers might benefit from protecting control frames having a
   potential impact on the transmission throughput, such as MAX_DATA or
   MAX_STREAM_DATA frames.  Rhis is why we choose a packet-based source
   symbol definition that considers the sequence of frames (or a sub-
   sequence of them) transmitting through QUIC packets as source
   symbols.

3.5.1.  Packet chunk source symbol definition

   In order to facilitate experiments, and in order to enable backward
   compatibility, the STREAM frames that carry application data are kept
   unmodified.  On the opposite, frames that carry one or more repair
   symbols use a dedicated REPAIR frame type, chosen within the type
   range dedicated to "Extension Frames".

3.5.1.1.  Packet payload and Source Symbols

   A QUIC packet payload consists in a set of QUIC frames.  These frames
   either carry application data (e.g.  STREAM frames) or control
   information (e.g.  MAX_DATA frames).  Each packet is either entirely
   received or lost and is uniquely identified by a monotonically
   increasing Packet Number.  As QUIC packets can be of different
   lengths, a special care should be taken to ensure having a fixed
   Source Symbol size to ease FEC Schemes implementations.

   Figure 1 illustrates how QUIC packets payloads can be divided into
   fixed-size chunks to facilitate the encoding of the source symbols.
   Any chunk is of fixed size (E bytes), leading a packet to potentially
   contain more than one chunk.

           < -E- > < -E- > < -E- > < -E- >
   +------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
   |Header|        Packet Payload         |  chunks 0, 1, 2, 3
   +------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
   |Header|  Packet Payload |                chunks 4, 5, 6
   +------+-------+-------+-------+--+
   |Header|      Packet Payload      |       chunks 7, 8, 9, 10
   +------+-------+-------+-------+--+

      Figure 1: Example of source symbol mapping, when the E value is
                             relatively small.

   Note:  We should take in account the fact that the repair payload
       will transit through a frame and so maximum source symbol size
       must take this into account to avoid having REPAIR frames that do
       not fit into a single packet.

   E MUST be strictly greater than zero bytes and strictly smaller than
   the minimum PMTU value allowed by QUIC.  The packet header is not
   part of the FEC-protected data.  When the packet payload size is not
   a multiple of E, zero-padding MUST be added at the beginning of the
   first chunk of the packet payload.  This is equivalent to insert
   PADDING frames at the beginning of the payload.  This zero-padding
   SHOULD NOT be sent on the wire and the packet is thus sent
   unmodified.  The choice of an appropriate value for E may depend on

   the use case (in particular on the nature of application data).  A
   reasonably small value reduces the expected value of the added
   padding needed to align the payload size with a multiple of E.
   However an overly small value also increases processing complexity
   (FEC encoding and decoding are performed over a larger linear system)
   so there is an incentive to use a larger value.  An appropriate
   balance should be found, and this choice is considered as out of
   scope for this document.

3.5.1.2.  Defining the source symbols

   We define source symbols as the concatenation of metadata and one
   packet chunk.  These source symbols are only used during encoding and
   decoding and are not sent as-is on the wire.  Figure 2 shows an
   example of 4 source symbols with their metadata.

                   <  -SS1- ><  -SS2- ><  -SS3- ><  -SS4- >
                      < -E- >   < -E- >   < -E- >   < -E- >
   +---------------+-+-------+-+-------+-+-------+-+-------+
   | Packet Header |0|       |1|       |1|       |2|       |
   +---------------+-+-------+-+-------+-+-------+-+-------+

      Figure 2: Example of source symbol mapping, when the E value is
                             relatively small.

   The metadata consist in one byte at the beginning of each source
   symbol indicating the limits of the packet.  The source symbol is
   thus of size E+1.  Hereunder are the possible values for the metadata
   byte and their meaning :

   o  0: the source symbol contains the first chunk of the packet
      payload;

   o  1: the source symbol contains a chunk that is neither the first or
      the last chunk of the packet payload;

   o  2: the source symbol contains the last chunk of the packet payload

   Each source symbol is assigned source symbol ID allowing to determine
   unambiguously its position in the encoding window.

3.5.2.  Packet-based source symbol definition

3.5.2.1.  Signaling packet payloads as source symbols on the wire

   An explicit signaling is needed by a decoder to identify the source
   symbols and their position in the coding window.  While the QUIC
   packet number increases monotonically, it cannot be used to identify



Swett, et al.           Expires December 28, 2019               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft               Coding for QUIC                   June 2019


   the position of a packet in the coding window as the packet number is
   not needed to increase by 1 for each new packet.  There is thus an
   ambiguity on the decoder-side between lost packets and packets that
   do not exist.  Similarly to FECFRAME, we propose to assign a
   identifier to source symbols to avoid this ambiguity.  This
   identifier is opaque to the protocol and will be defined by the
   underlying FEC schemes.  This is out of the scope of this document.
   An example of identifier could be an integer increasing by 1 for each
   new source symbol

   In order to announce the source symbol identifier to the FEC decoder,
   we propose to add a new frame, the FEC_SOURCE_ID frame to packets
   whose payload will be considered as a source symbol.  The
   FEC_SOURCE_ID frame is part of the packet payload itself.  Figure 3
   shows the format of the FEC_SOURCE_ID frame.  Any packet containing a
   FEC_SOURCE_ID frame MUST see its payload considered as a source
   symbol.

    0                   1                   2                   3

              content is defined by the underlying FEC scheme

   Note:  We might want to remove the following paragraph as it could be
       a duplicate of what has been already said.

   During the FEC encoding phase, additional data can be added to the
   source symbol.  These data are only added during the encoding and
   MUST NOT be transmitted on the wire.  The encoder and decoder MUST
   agree on the addition of these data to the source symbol in order to
   avoid decoding errors.  Here are some examples of data that can be
   added to a source symbol during encoding and that will be decoded
   upon a source symbol recovery :

   o  The packet number: adding the packet number allows the decoder to
      know which packet has been recovered and potentially send a
      feedback of which packet has been recovered to the QUIC sender.

   o  Additional QUIC frames: the FEC encoder can for example add
      PADDING frames to a source symbol before proceeding to encoding.
      Adding PADDING frames to source symbols before encoding allows
      protecting packets of different sizes.  The smaller packet payload
      will be added PADDING frames to match the size of the largest
      packet payload in the encoding window.

Internet-Draft               Coding for QUIC                   June 2019


   Note:  Maybe the decision of adding data such as padding in the
       source symbols should be leaved to the underlying FEC Scheme.

   Besides adding data to source symbols before encoding, some frames
   can be removed from the source symbol if their protection is not
   crucial for the transmission in order to reduce the size of the
   source symbol.  For example, ACK frames can be systematically
   stripped out of the source symbols.  Stream frames of non-delay-
   sensitive streams could also be removed from the source symbol.  The
   encoder and decoder MUST agree on which frames must be stripped out
   of packet payloads.  This information might for example be encoded in
   the Source Symbol ID by the FEC encoder.

   Note:  We might want to propose standard ways/algorithms to add/
       remove data before the encoding ?

3.5.3.  Signaling a symbol recovery

   When source symbols are recovered, a QUIC receiver SHOULD advertise
   the symbols recoveries to the sender in order to avoid retransmission
   of already received data.  The QUIC receiver MUST NOT acknowledge
   packets that have been recovered, as it would interfere with the
   behaviour of loss-based congestion controls such as [Cubic].

3.5.4.  About Gaps in the Set of Source Symbols Considered During
        Encoding

   A given FEC Scheme MAY support or not the presence of gaps in the set
   of source symbols that constitute a block (for Block codes) or an
   encoding window (for Sliding Window codes).  A potential cause for
   non contiguous sets of source symbols is the acknowledgment of one of
   them.  When this happens, the QUIC sending endpoint may want to
   remove this source symbol from further FEC encodings.  This is
   particularly true with Sliding Window codes because of their
   flexibility during FEC encoding (i.e., the encoding window can change
   between two consecutive FEC encodings).

   Supporting gaps can be motivated by the desire to reduce encoding and
   decoding complexity since there are fewer variables.  However this
   choice has major consequences in terms of signaling.  Indeed each
   repair symbol transmitted MUST be accompanied with enough information
   for the QUIC decoding endpoint to unambiguously identify the exact
   composition of the block or encoding window.  Without any gap, the
   identity of the first source symbol plus the number of symbols in the
   block or encoding window is sufficient.  With gaps, a more complex
   encoding needs to be used, perhaps similar to the encoding used for
   selective acknowledgments.

Internet-Draft               Coding for QUIC                   June 2019


   Whether or not gaps are supported MUST be clarified in each FEC
   Scheme.

3.6.  FEC Scheme Negotiation in QUIC

   FEC Scheme negotiation has two goals:

   o  Selecting a FEC Scheme (or FEC Schemes) that can be used by the
      QUIC transmission and reception endpoints.  This process requires
      an exchange between them;

   o  Communicating a certain number of parameters, the "Configuration
      Information", that are not expected to change over the session
      lifetime.  For instance, this is the case of the symbol size
      parameter, E (in bytes), that needs either to be agreed between
      the endpoints, or chosen by the sender and communicated to the
      receiver(s);

       *  It is likely that FEC Scheme negotiation requires the use of a
          new dedicated Extension Frame Type.  The details remain TBD.

       *  The Negotiation Frame Type format remains TBD.

       *  How to communicate the parameters remains TBD.

       *  The present document only provides high level principles, the
          details are of course the responsibility of the FEC Scheme.

       *  In case negotiation is different when protecting a single
          versus several streams, this section may be moved to the
          respective sections.

       *  How does it work in case of a multicast session?

       *  Do we negotiate here a FEC Scheme on a per-Stream basis (or
          group of Streams to be protected jointly)?  Or do we negotiate
          a FEC Scheme on a QUIC session basis, therefore to be used for
          all the Streams that need FEC protection?

3.6.1.  FEC Scheme Selection Process

   Let us consider the FEC Scheme selection process between the QUIC
   endpoints.  Figure 4 illustrates the principle when a QUIC reception
   endpoint initiates the exchange.

    Figure 4: Example FEC Scheme selection process, during the initial
                               negotiation.

   The supported_fec_scheme_16b and supported_fec_scheme_32b are two new
   TransportParameterId to be added to the "Table 7: Initial QUIC
   Transport Parameters Entries" Section 13.1, of [QUIC-transport].  The
   supported_fec_scheme_32b contains a 32-bit data field to carry opaque
   32-bit value, while the supported_fec_scheme_64b contains a 64-bit
   data field to carry opaque 64-bit value (see Section 3.6.2).

   It is possible that the QUIC endpoint that receives one or more FEC
   Scheme proposals from the initiator cannot select any of them.  In
   that case the negotiation process fails...

   Editor's notes:

       *  So what?  How does it finishes?  Consequences?

       *  Can the second QUIC endpoint change the proposed static
          parameters?  In that case can the initator refuse?

3.6.2.  FEC Scheme Configuration Information

   Let us now focus on the communication of configuration information
   specific to the selected FEC Scheme.  In Figure 4, the
   supported_fec_scheme_32b{FS1_Encoding_ID} contains a field meant to
   carry the FEC Encoding ID of the FEC Scheme selected plus addditional
   configuration information if any.  If a 32 bit opaque field is not
   sufficient, the supported_fec_scheme_64b can be used instead and
   proposes a 64 bit opaque field.

3.7.  Procedures when Protecting a Single QUIC Stream

   This section focuses on the simple case where FEC protection is
   applied to a single QUIC stream.  We consider a unidirectional data
   flow between a QUIC sending endpoint and one (or more) QUIC reception
   endpoints.

3.8.  Signaling Considerations within REPAIR Frames

   Repair data, computed during FEC encoding, is sent within a dedicated
   REPAIR frame type, chosen within the type range dedicated to
   "Extension Frames".

   The REPAIR frame format is FEC Scheme dependent.  The document
   specifying a FEC Scheme to be used with QUIC MUST define the REPAIR
   frame format, among other things.  The REPAIR frame MUST carry enough
   information for a QUIC reception endpoint to understand exactly how
   this repair symbol(s) has(ve) been generated.  It implies that each
   REPAIR symbol MUST communicate the block (with block codes) or
   encoding window (with Sliding Window codes) composition.  When there
   is no gap in the source symbol set, this MAY be achieved by
   communicating:

   o  the offset of the first source symbol of the block or encoding
      window;

   o  the number of source symbols in the block or encoding window .

   Editor's notes:

       *  This I-D proposes to define a single generic REPAIR frame
          type, but an alternative could be to have a one-to-one mapping
          between a REPAIR frame type and a specific FEC Scheme.

       *  The use of frame type within the Extension Frames range for
          REPAIR frames is meant to facilitate experimentations.  If the
          use of coding in QUIC is recognized as having benefits, a
          dedicated (or more, see above) frame type could be selected
          later on.

4.  Procedures when Protecting Several QUIC Streams

   This section focuses on the general case where FEC protection is
   globally applied across two or more QUIC streams.

   Editor's notes:  It is not clear whether this use-case is needed.  It
       adds specification and implementation complexity that need to be
       balanced with the expected benefits.

       *  Receiver: A first complexity comes from the requirement to
          identify to which stream a decoded source symbol belongs to.
          This is also one of the main difficulty for FECFRAME (both
          with block and sliding window codes) which required to
          distinguish an ADU (submitted by the application) from an ADUI

          (the same ADU plus an additional FlowID among other things).
          Do we want this level of complexity?

       *  Sender: Another complexity comes from the encoding window
          management at a sender.  With multiple streams, shifting the
          encoding window to the right needs to be done based on
          timestamps associated to source symbols of the various
          streams: the oldest source symbol across all the streams will
          be removed.

       *  When two largely different streams are protected togethers
          (e.g., a high definition 4K video flow plus the associated
          relatively low-rate audio stream), is this extra complexity
          balanced by significant performance improvements compared to
          an independent protection on each stream (intuition is yes,
          the low bitrate flow is better protected iff the encoding
          window is large enough)?  And when the various streams have a
          comparable bitrate?  More work (incl. experimental work) is
          needed to answer this question.

4.1.  Application data, STREAM Frame data and Source Symbols

   Within each stream, the source symbols MUST be defined as in the
   simple case of a single stream.  Figure 1 remains valid.

4.2.  Block or Encoding Window Management

   The details of how to create the block or encoding window are
   specific to the FEC Scheme.  A possible approach is the following.

   When creating the block (block FEC code) or encoding window (sliding
   window FEC code), the source symbols to consider of each stream are
   appended.  All the relevant source symbols of the first stream are
   appended, followed by all the source symbols of the second stream,
   etc.  These sequences do not follow any timing consideration in order
   to simplify signaling.

   Figure 5 illustrates, in case of a Sliding Window FEC Scheme, an
   encoding window with source symbols belonging to two streams, of
   Stream ID 120 and 51 respectively.

                  and FEC protection across two streams.

4.3.  Signaling Considerations within STREAM and REPAIR Frames

   Source data on each stream is transmitted within STREAM frames, as
   would happen without any FEC based loss recovery mechanism.

   Repair symbols, generated during FEC encoding as a linear combination
   of source symbols that belong to one or more of the streams, are
   transmitted within REPAIR frames.  Each REPAIR frame can be
   associated to any of the input streams it protects, and therefore
   associated to any of the associated Stream IDs.

   Editor's notes:  Check that indeed, with FEC protection across
       several streams, assigning a REPAIR frame to any of the streams
       it protects is meaningful.  Should an approach for selecting one
       stream (and Stream ID) be preferred?

   The REPAIR frame format is FEC Scheme dependent and MUST be defined
   by the FEC Scheme specification document.  One of the key information
   of this REPAIR frame is the composition of the block (with block
   codes) or encoding window (with sliding window codes) used to perform
   FEC encoding.  Indeed, this is the only manner to convey this
   information since an application flow is not predictable (e.g., if an
   application flow is momentarily suspended, the composition of the
   block or encoding window will be affected).  One possibility is to
   list, in each REPAIR frame header:

   o  the actual number of streams considered (the maximum number is
      known after the negotiation step, but if one of the streams
      remains silent for some time, it may not contribute during
      encoding and therefore be absent from the block or encoding
      window);

   o  for each stream concerned, its Stream ID, the offset of the first
      source symbol considered as well as the length, i.e., the number
      of bytes considered.

   This approach does not enable to keep track of the source symbol
   ordering across streams, but enables a non ambiguous description of
   the encoding window.

   The FEC Scheme specification MUST also detail how to manage the block
   or encoding window.  For instance, should the oldest source symbol of
   any stream be removed from the encoding window when this latter is
   shifted to the right?  This would mean that a timestamp is attached
   to each source symbol in order to identify the oldest one across all
   streams.
