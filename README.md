Coding for QUIC Internet-drafts

This repository contains I-D and material related to the use of FEC codes in QUIC transport.
It's a joint work carried out in the context of the IRTF NWCRG (coding for efficient network communications research group) as a first step, before going to the QUIC IETF group.
You'll find:

- the main framework document;
- side documents that describe FEC Schemes that could be used along with QUIC, following the framework recommendations.

Comments can be made to the NWCRG mailing list: nwcrg@irtf.org
