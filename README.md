# coding_for_quic
Coding for QUIC Internet-drafts

This repository contains I-D and material related to the use of FEC codes in QUIC transport.
It's a work initiated in the IRTF NWCRG (coding for efficient network communications research group) as a first step, the goal being to move to the QUIC IETF working group when sufficiently mature.

This repo contains:

- the main framework document (draft-swett-nwcrg-coding-for-quic);
- side documents that specify FEC Schemes that could be used along with QUIC, following the framework recommendations.

Comments can be made to the NWCRG mailing list: nwcrg@irtf.org
